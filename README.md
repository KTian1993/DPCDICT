# DPCDICT
In this study, based on a deconstructed crossing decision process at uncontrolled intersections with continuous traffic, we reinterpret pedestrian crossing behaviour from a visual collision risk perspective. Notably, from the perspective of traffic flow characteristics, we explain and model one effect of pedestrian waiting time on their crossing behaviour, whereby pedestrians optimise crossing decisions by comparing the risk of approaching vehicles.
A demonstration video of the model is provided. Please check the file, Demonstration.mp4.
